# Cage20
Cage20 is a population of 600 accessions established in Roza field in 2021. 
This is an alfalfa population of 600 accessions planted in Roza field (Prosser, WA) in 2021 to identify markers associated with drought stress and genomic selection. ~550 genotypes (individuals) were initially genotyped using DArT (DAl22-7011).
550 genotypes were genotyped in May 2022. The rest of the 50 genotypes were genotyped in September 2022. Data of 50 genotypes are in project: DAl22-7535.
PCA analysis was done in this population finding a population structure in 14 clusters.

Data analysis can be done using two-stage analysis or using random regression. Both can be done in ASReml.
Add heritability and the way to calculate it. Double check if the harvest during the first year is useful.
