# Roza_2021
Roza 2021 also known as Cage20. 
This is an alfalfa population of 600 individuals planted in Roza field (Prosser, WA) to dientify markers associated with drought stress. ~550 genotypes (individuals) were genotyped using DArT.
550 genotypes were genotyped on May 2022. The rest of 50 genotypes were genotyped on September 2022
PCA analysis was done in this population finging an population structure in 14 clusters.

Data analysis can be done using two stage analysis or using random regression. Both can be done in ASReml.
Add heritability, and the way to calculate it. Couble check if the harvest during the first year is useful.
